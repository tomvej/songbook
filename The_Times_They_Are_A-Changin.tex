Come |gather 'round |people whe|rever you |roam
    G               Em      C                D
And |admit that the |waters |around you have |grown
    G               Em              C                G
And |accept it that |soon you'll be |drenched to the |bone.
        G        Am            D
If your |time to |you is worth |savin'
         D             Dsus2/C             G            D
Then you |better start |swimmin' or you'll |sink like a~|stone
        G      C           D     G
For the |times |they are a-|chang|in'.

\strophe*
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'.
'Cause the loser now will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'.
\endstrophe

\strophe*
Come senators, congressmen please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'.
\endstrophe

\strophe*
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin'.
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'.
\endstrophe

\strophe*
The line it is drawn the curse it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past
The order is rapidly fadin'.
And the first one now will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'.
