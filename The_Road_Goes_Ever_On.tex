    D
The |Road goes ever on and on
C                         D
|Down from the door where |it began.
    G              D
Now |far ahead the |Road has gone,
    G       A        D
And |I must |follow, |if I can,
\endstrophe

\strophe*
Pursuing it with eager feet,
Until it joins some larger way
Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say. 
\endstrophe

\strophe*
Roads go ever ever on
Under cloud and under star,
Yet feet that wandering have gone
Turn at last to home afar.
Eyes that fire and sword have seen
And horror in the halls of stone
Look at last on meadows green
And trees and hills they long have known. 
\endstrophe

\strophe*
Still round the corner there may wait
A new road or a secret gate,
And though I oft have passed them by,
A day will come at last when I
Shall take the hidden paths that run
West of the Moon, East of the Sun. 
\endstrophe
