|Sad voices they're calling
             C                  Am
Our precious |girl she can't be |gone

How bitter this morning

When daddy's darling
             C            Am
Went out and |started her |day

Am              C            G
|Wasn't there a~|dream, last |night
                    Am
Like a~spring never |ending
                                      C
Still the water runs clear through my |mind
       G                  Am
On the |field I can see a~|fiddler
                   C
The fiddler on the |green
    G      Am
And |a~sad |boy
               C
I~took him too |early
          G
Would you |mind
          F
Would you |mind
          G
Would you |mind \ldots
-
|If I take you

To be with you
To be with you
To be with you
To be with you
\endstrophe

\strophe*
The sun seemed bright
The air was clear
The air was clear
A~trick of light
Turned red into green
She saw the light
Her face was pale
Her body smashed
Her beauty's gone
\endstrophe

\strophe*
Isn't it a~shame
The reaper said
He is quite alone here
And still waiting for you
Oh I really did fail for the first time
Spoke the fiddler, poor old fiddler
The fiddler on the green
The fiddler on the green
It would be nice \ldots
Take my hand
\endstrophe

\strophe
Am
|Just hold my hand
     C         G
I'll |take you |there
     Am            C_G_F_G
Your |pain will go |away
