\strophe
E7/G#        Am      F
|Man, it's a |hot one|
E           E7/G#            Am      F
|Like seven |inches from the |midday |sun
E           E7/G#           Dm7         Dm7/C      Hm\-
|I hear you |whispering the |words that |melt every|one
    E7/G#        Am_F_E__E7/G#
But |you stay so |cool
\endstrophe

\strophe*
My mu√±equita,
My Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove
\endstrophe

\refrain
           Am         F           E      E7/G#
And if you |said this |life ain't |good e|nough
        Am       F         E         E7/G#
I would |give my |world to |lift you |up
        Am         F        E       E7/G#      Dm7_Dm7/C_Hm\-
I could |change my |life to |better |suit your |mood
  E7/G#            F#sus4_E__E7/G#
Be|cause you're so |smooth
\endstrophe

\varrefrain
         Am             F      E          E7/G#
And it's |just like the |ocean |under the |moon
             Am            F              E         E7/G#
Oh, it's the |same as the e|motion that I |get from |you
    Am               F                E      E7/G#
You |got the kind of |lovin' that can |be so |smooth, yeah
Dm7                          E                            Am_F_E__E7/G#
|Give me your heart, make it |real or else forget about it|
\endstrophe

\strophe*
But I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word I hear your name
calling me out
\endstrophe

\strophe*
Out from the barrio
You hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world, so soft and slow
It's turning you round and round
\endstrophe

Or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Give me your heart, make it real
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
