\strophe
   Am                              C
An |old cowboy went ridin' out one |dark and windy day,
Am                            C
|upon a~ridge he rested as he |went along his way
     Am
when |all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
F                                     Am
|plowin' through the ragged skies -- and |up a~cloudy draw.
\endstrophe

\strophe*
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
a bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard -- and he heard their mournful cry
\endstrophe

\refrain
Am       C
|Yipie i |oh
        Am
Yipie i |ay
F             Dm      Am
|Ghost riders |in the |sky.
\endstrophe


\strophe*
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's ridin' hard to catch that herd but he 'aint caught 'em yet
'cause they've all to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire -- as they ride on, hear their cry
\endstrophe

\strophe*
As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
if you want to save your soul from hell a~ridin' on our range
cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride.
driving with the Devil's herd -- across this endless skies.
