E7/G#        Am      F
|Man, it's a |hot one|
E           E7/G#            Am      F
|Like seven |inches from the |midday |sun
E           E7/G#               Dm7    Dm7/C      Hm\-
|I hear you |whispering and the |words |melt every|one
    E7/G#        Am_F_E__E7/G#
But |you stay so |cool
\endstrophe

\strophe*
My mu√±equita,
My Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove
\endstrophe

\refrain*
And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Oh, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real or else forget about it
\endstrophe

\strophe*
But I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
\endstrophe

\strophe*
Out from the barrio
You hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world, so soft and slow
It's turning you round and round
\endstrophe

Oh, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real or else forget about it

\strophe*
Or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Give me your heart, make it real
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
