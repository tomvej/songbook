Suddenly (oh) it seemed so clear
All the blindness was taken away
She closed her eyes and she called out my name
She was never ever never ever seen again

She is gone and I fall from grace
No healing charm covers my wounds

\strophe*
Alone,
Woe, woe in the end,
Woe, woe in the end,
We shall lose all our faith
Leave it all behind,
Soon there will be night
We shall fade
We shall fade
We shall fade
