\strophe
           Hm
There's an |old tale wrought with the mystery of Tom
    Asus2
The |poet and his muse
        F#m               G
And the |magic lake which |gave a life
       A          F#m   Hm
To the |words the |poet |used
\endstrophe

\strophe*
Now the muse she was his happiness
And he rhymed about her grace
And told her stories of treasures deep
Beneath the blackened waves
\endstrophe

\strophe*
'Till in the stillness of one dawn
Still in its mystic crown
The muse she went down to the lake
And in the waves she drowned
\endstrophe

\refrain
G                             A
|And now to see your love set |free
Hm                               E
|You will need the witch's cabin |key
Em                               F#m
|Find the lady of the light gone |mad with the night
G               A        Hm
|That's how you |reshape |destiny
\endstrophe

\strophe*
The poet came down to the lake
To call out to his dear
'When there was no answer
'He was overcome with fear
\endstrophe

\strophe*
He searched in vain for his treasure lost
And too soon the night would fall
And only his own echo
Would wail back at his call
\endstrophe

\strophe*
And when he swore to bring back his love
By the stories he'd create
Nightmares shifted in their sleep
In the darkness of the lake
\endstrophe

\varrefrain*
And now to see your love set free
You will need the witch's cabin key
Find the lady of the light still ravin' in the night
That's how you reshape destiny
\endstrophe

\columnbreak

\strophe*
In the dead of night she came to him
With darkness in her eyes
Wearing a mourning gown
Sweet words as her disguise
\endstrophe

\strophe*
He took her in without a word
For he saw his grave mistake
And vowed them both to silence
Deep beneath the lake
\endstrophe

\strophe*
Now if its real or just a dream
One mystery remains
For it is said on moonless nights
They may still haunt this place
\endstrophe
