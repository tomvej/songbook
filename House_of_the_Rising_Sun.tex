\strophe*
My mother was a~tailor
She sewed my new bluejeans
My father was a~gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans
\endstrophe

\strophe*
Now the only thing a~gambler needs
Is a~suitcase and trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on, a~drunk
\endstrophe

\strophe*
Oh mother tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun
\endstrophe

\strophe*
Well, I~got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain
\endstrophe

\strophe*
Well, there is a~house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a~poor boy
And God I know I'm one
\endstrophe
