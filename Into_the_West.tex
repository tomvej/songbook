C    G
|Lay |down
Dm                    Am
|Your sweet and weary |head
C             G
|The night is |falling
Dm                          Am
|You have come to journey's |end

Sleep now
And dream of the ones who came before
They are calling
From across the distant shore
\endstrophe

Am          C
|Why do you |weep?
F               G                Am

              C
Soon you will |see
F            G                Am
|All of your |fears will pass |away

Safe in my |arms

|You're only |sleeping
\endstrophe

|On the horizon?
C                       G

C
|Across the sea

|The ships have come to carry you |home

Am            Em
|And all will |turn

|All Souls |pass

\strophe*
Hope fades
Into the world of night
Through shadows falling
Out of memory and time
\endstrophe

\strophe*
Don't say
We have come now to the end
White shores are calling
You and I will meet again
\endstrophe

|And you'll be here in my |arms
F     G
|Just |sleeping

A light on the water
Grey ships pass
