\strophe
G     D                       Am
|Mama |take this badge off of |me
G        D          C
|I~can't |use it any|more
G             D                 Am
|It's getting |dark too dark to |see
G               D                     C
|Feels like I'm |knockin' on heaven's |door
\endstrophe

\refrain*
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
\endstrophe

\strophe*
Mama put my guns in the ground
I~can't shoot them anymore
That cold black cloud is comin' down
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
